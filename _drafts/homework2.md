Ideas of models to implement:

- Simple example to familiarize themselves with the language
   - Use same as lecture 2: simple parametric, then mixture
   - Output: 
                        - clustering?
                        - likelihood of a point?
                        - histograms of parameters
   - Dataset: 
   
- Hierarchical model, missing data (several datasets with different degrees of missingness)
	- Character n-grams over several languages?
	
- Time series --- HMM?

- Models from stan/py books?
