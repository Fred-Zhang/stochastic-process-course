title: "Exercise 1: Forward simulation"
category: 'Homework'
---


*Forward simulation* from stochastic processes is generally simple and can often be done exactly. In statistical settings, a more complex task is generally required, *posterior simulation*, but forward simulation is still very useful for a few reasons. First, it is a great pedagogical tool for understand stochastic processes. Second, it is a useful debugging tool when implementing probabilistic inference software (more on this later).

This first exercise will be devoted to forward simulation for a range of stochastic processes. The majority of the remaining exercises will cover posterior simulation (or sampling), focussing on a more restricted set of processes at a time. 

**Note:** The first question will be published by Jan 7. To maximize the benefits of the first lab (Wed the 8th after class), please try to get started with the first question.
