The first homework is to generate data from DP and CTMC. Write in markdown and LaTeX here.

Test latex:

\\begin{equation}
P(X\_{t+1} = x\_{t+1} | X\_1 = x\_1, ..., X\_t = x\_t) = P(X\_{t+1} = x\_{t+1} | X\_t = x\_t)
\\end{equation}

TODO: find out how to change red font to black?

Test Java:

``` java
public void foo(String str)
{
  System.out.println(str);
}
```
