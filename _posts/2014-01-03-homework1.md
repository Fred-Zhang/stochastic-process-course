# Exercise 1: Forward Simulation

*Forward simulation* from stochastic processes is generally simple and can often be done exactly. In statistical settings, a more complex task is generally required, *posterior simulation*, but forward simulation is still very useful for a few reasons. First, it is a great pedagogical tool for understand stochastic processes. Second, it is a useful debugging tool when implementing probabilistic inference software (more on this later).

This first exercise will be devoted to forward simulation for a range of stochastic processes. The majority of the remaining exercises will cover posterior simulation (or sampling), focussing on a more restricted set of processes at a time.

Test latex:

\\begin{eqnarray}
x < 5 
\\end{eqnarray}

\\begin{eqnarray}
P(X\_{t+1} &= x\_{t+1} | X\_1 = x\_1, ..., X\_t = x\_t) & = & P(X\_{t+1} = x\_{t+1} | X\_t = x\_t) \\\\
 & = & 0 
\\end{eqnarray}

\\begin{eqnarray}
P(X\_{t+1} = x\_{t+1} | X\_1 = x\_1, ..., X\_t = x\_t) & = & e^{\log 2\frac{\log x}{\log 2}}\\\\
& = & 0 
\end{eqnarray}

TODO: find out how to change red font to black?
Failed to find out how to change the default math color -- one workaround is to set the color via 

```
$\{color}{...}$ 
```

Test Java:

``` java
public void foo(String str)
{
  System.out.println(str);
}
```
