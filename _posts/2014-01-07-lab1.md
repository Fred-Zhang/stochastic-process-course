### Plan for first lab

- Additional information on CTMCs
- How to get started writing the code in R:
  - How to create a ``run`` command
  - How to read command line argument
- Quick survey to determine what will be covered in next labs
- Logistics: checking everybody can log in the machines
  
### Notes from Seong
  
- Create a file and name it as ``run`` and type the below line in the file:

  ``` bash
  Rscript test.r file1 file2
  ```

- Create a file (``test.r``), write the following R code in it:

  ``` r
  # below code loads the command line arguments to character vector
  args<-commandArgs(TRUE)
  print(args[0])
  # take a look at what's inside
  print(args[1])
  print(args[2])
  ```
  
- From the command line, execute the file ``run``

	```
	$ chmod 700 # this command gives the owner of the file execution permission (as well as read and write)
	$ ./run
	```
		

### Lab activities to do by the next lab

- Setting up a java environment (instructions will be posted shortly)
