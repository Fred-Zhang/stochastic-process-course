### Plan for first lab

- Additional information on CTMCs
- How to get started writing the code in R:
  - How to create a ``run`` command
  - How to read command line argument
- Quick survey to determine what will be covered in next labs
- Logistics: checking everybody can log in the machines
  
### Notes from Seong: How to create run file for submission   

There are two ways to do this, you can choose whichever approach you prefer. I will assume that you 
are programming in R. 

1. Write your code in some file, (for example, ``q1.r``), write the following R code to read in the command line arguments:

  ``` r
  # below code loads the command line arguments to character vector
  args<-commandArgs(TRUE)
  dnaFilePath<-args[1]
  matrixFilePath<-args[2]
  
  # write your code here
  ```
  
  Create a file and name it as ``run`` without any extension. Type the below line in the file:

  ``` bash
  Rscript q1.r $1 $2
  ```

  If you are using python or Java, you would replace the content of the ``run`` file by python or java.
  
2. First, check where the ``Rscript`` program is located by typing the following at the command line prompt:

  ```
  $ which Rscript
  /usr/bin/Rscript
  ```

  Create a file and name it as ``run`` without any extension. Place the below line as the first line of ``run:

  ``` bash
  #!/usr/bin/Rscript

  args<-commandArgs(TRUE)
  dnaFilePath<-args[1]
  matrixFilePath<-args[2]
  
  # write your code here
  ```

  To test that your program, you can execute the file ``run`` from the command line prompt:

	```
	$ chmod 700 run # this command gives the owner of the file execution permission (as well as read and write)
	$ ./run dnafile.txt matrixFile.txt
	```


### Lab activities to do by the next lab

- Setting up a java environment (instructions will be posted shortly)
