Syllabus: Statistical Modeling with Stochastic Processes.
=========================================================

**Description:** Stochastic processes are powerful tools for constructing the rich models needed to capture the complexity of our world.  We will discuss an array of concrete examples where stochastic processes are used to perform sophisticated statistical inferences.  After going through these examples, you will be familiar with the main building blocks, you will know how to compose them to create new models, you will be able to design inference algorithms for your models and you will have a better understanding of the limits of these models and algorithms. Throughout the course there will be an emphasis on computational statistics and on applications in machine learning, phylogenetics, computational biology and linguistics.	
	
**Prerequisite:** STAT 460 / 560 or MATH 419 or CS 540 or equivalent (if you are not sure, come talk to me after one or two lectures).
