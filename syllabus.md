Syllabus: Statistical Modeling with Stochastic Processes.
=========================================================

**Description:** Stochastic processes are powerful tools for constructing the rich models needed to capture the complexity of our world.  We will discuss an array of concrete examples where stochastic processes are used to perform sophisticated statistical inferences.  After going through these examples, you will be familiar with the main building blocks, you will know how to compose them to create new models, you will be able to design inference algorithms for your models and you will have a better understanding of the limits of these models and algorithms. Throughout the course there will be an emphasis on computational statistics and on applications in machine learning, phylogenetics, computational biology and linguistics.	
	
**Prerequisite:** STAT 460 / 560 or MATH 419 or CS 540 or equivalent (if you are not sure, come talk to me after one or two lectures).

**Important notes:**

- I will try my best to post lecture notes  (or at least, draft of) in advance. You can access them in the ``Lecture Notes`` tab.
- Attendance at labs optional, but strongly recommended. Some labs may have suggested pre-reading/pre-coding, see the tab ``Labs`` above.
- Discussion forum: To encourage richer open exchanges, Seong and I will *only* use this platform to answer course-related questions (unless for personal matters). See ``Contact`` link in the top menu.
- Languages used in the exercises: Java, Bugs, R.
 - R is great to use existing statistical methodologies, but to develop new ones, it is ideal to have other tools in the toolbox.
 - We will organize remedial tutorials for Java/Bugs as we go along. Please try to drop by if you are not familiar with the covered topic.
- Environments supported: Stat net, Mac OS X, linux.

**Evaluation** 

- Weekly exercises (they will involve coding) 45%
- Final research project (teams encouraged) 45%
- Participation: 10%
   - in class and/or labs and/or piazza and/or office hours, reporting typos in notes, 
   - scribing/editing activity.
   
**Editing duties:** Everyone should claim editorship of one lecture. There should be one or two editors per lecture. The editor(s) are responsible for:

- Adding some supplementary references, notes, observations, etc.
- Correcting errors and typos.
- Participating in piazza discussion related to the lecture.
- Adding the diagrams and figures that are not already included.

This will be coordinated via github. Please create an account if you do not have one already.

**Textbook:** There are no textbook. Resources and pointers will be posted in the online lecture notes.

**Office hours:** We will reserve time at the lab for Q&A. More office hours will be added as needed.
