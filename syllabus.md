Syllabus: Statistical Modeling with Stochastic Processes.
=========================================================

**Description:** Stochastic processes are powerful tools for constructing the rich models needed to capture the complexity of our world.  We will discuss an array of concrete examples where stochastic processes are used to perform sophisticated statistical inferences.  After going through these examples, you will be familiar with the main building blocks, you will know how to compose them to create new models, you will be able to design inference algorithms for your models and you will have a better understanding of the limits of these models and algorithms. Throughout the course there will be an emphasis on computational statistics and on applications in machine learning, phylogenetics, computational biology and linguistics.	
	
**Prerequisite:** STAT 460 / 560 or MATH 419 or CS 540 or equivalent (if you are not sure, come talk to me after one or two lectures).

**Important notes:**

- I will try my best to post lecture notes  (or at least, draft of) in advance. You can access them in the ``Lecture Notes`` tab.
- Attendance at labs optional, but strongly recommended. Some labs may have suggested pre-reading/pre-coding, see the tab ``Labs`` above.
- Discussion forum: To encourage richer open exchanges, Seong and I will *only* use this platform to answer course-related questions (unless for personal matters). See ``Contact`` link in the top menu.
- Languages used in the exercises: Java, Bugs, R.
 - R is great to use existing statistical methodologies, but to develop new ones, it is ideal to have other tools in the toolbox.
 - We will organize remedial tutorials for Java/Bugs as we go along. Please try to drop by if you are not familiar with the covered topic.
- Environments supported: Stat net, Mac OS X, linux.

**Evaluation** 

- Weekly exercises (they will involve coding) 45%
- Final research project (teams encouraged) 45%
- Participation: 10%
   - in class and/or labs and/or piazza and/or office hours, reporting typos in notes, 
   - scribing/editing activity.
   
**Editing duties:** Everyone should claim editorship of one lecture. There should be one or two editors per lecture. The editor(s) are responsible for:

1. Adding some supplementary references, notes, observations, etc.
2. Correcting errors and typos.
3. Participating in piazza discussion related to the lecture.
4. Adding the diagrams and figures that are not already included.

The editors should complete these tasks within 1 week of the lecture. This will be coordinated via github. Please create an account if you do not have one already. See below for details.

**The editing process:** 

- On the week that you will be scribing, on the day of the lecture (or before) send in a email to Seong your github account, he will give you access to the website github, available at this [address](https://github.com/alexandrebouchard/stochastic-process-course). 
- The files corresponding to the lecture notes are available in ``_posts/``. If you have not used git before, you can edit the file directly from the github website (click on a file, and then on the ``Edit`` button), but we also encourage you to learn using git, either with a graphical interface (SourceTree or Github's), or via command line (many available via google, for example [there](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)). 
- Please try as much as possible to edit only the file corresponding your lecture to avoid too many merge conflicts. 
- Note also that some changes might be pushed automatically to the website, so make sure to push commit to server only if you are sure the change is good (especially relevant if you are using the git server directly, and this is why we strongly recommend to use your own local git and then push from it).

**Textbook:** There are no textbook. Resources and pointers will be posted in the online lecture notes.

**Office hours:** We will reserve time at the lab for Q&A. More office hours will be added as needed.
